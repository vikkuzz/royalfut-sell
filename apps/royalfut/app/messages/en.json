    "a39": "Coins are the first choice of most EA Sports FC players around the world because of their low cost, and the ability to spend them much more beneficially for your FC Ultimate Team club. You can spend Ultimate Team coins on in-game items that have been listed on the Transfer Market by other players. These could be player cards, coach cards, uniform kits, stadiums, consumables and more. And most importantly, none of these can be bought with FC Points. With FC Points, you can buy packs from the FC Ultimate Team store and get access to the FC Ultimate Team Drafts. However, you can do both of these things using coins as well. In terms of real money, it's more than 5 times cheaper to shop in-game using EAS FC coins instead of FC Points. Start shopping for coins with us and see for yourself 😉",

However, keep in mind that the delivery time primarily depends on the amount of ordered coins.",
    "a51": "As for the Player Auction delivery method, the timings of this option depend entirely on you. The coin transfer is carried out by buying and selling player cards. It takes an average of 3-10 cards suggested by our system to be bought and sold by you for the order to be completed using this method. But note that your starting balance plays an important role in this scenario — the bigger it is, the faster the delivery will be processed, so try to make it as high as possible before placing an order, for example you can sell unwanted cards.",
